# 🔍 How to Verify Your MCP Server is Being Used

## **Method 1: Look for Unique Signatures**

Your debug server now includes unique identifiers in ALL responses:

### ✅ **What to Look For:**
Every response from YOUR server will contain:
```
🌤️ [YOUR CUSTOM MCP SERVER]
```

### **Test Commands:**
1. **Hello Test**: Ask "hello" in MCP UI
   - **Your Server**: "🌤️ [YOUR CUSTOM MCP SERVER] Hello! This response proves your custom weather server is working! 👋"
   - **Default Tool**: Just "Hello" or generic response

2. **Weather Test**: Ask "what's the weather in Paris"
   - **Your Server**: "🌤️ [YOUR CUSTOM MCP SERVER] Weather in Paris: 24.1°C, Clouds, 65% humidity"
   - **Default Tool**: May not include the custom prefix

## **Method 2: Watch Server Terminal Logs**

### **Real-Time Verification:**
1. Keep your terminal open where the server is running
2. When you ask for weather in MCP UI, you should see:
   ```
   🔍 DEBUG: get_weather called with city='Paris'
   ✅ DEBUG: API call successful, returning: [response]
   ```

3. **If you DON'T see these logs** = MCP UI is using a different tool

## **Method 3: Test Unique Features**

Your server has features that default weather tools don't have:

### **Unique Tools:**
1. **hello**: Most weather tools don't have a hello command
2. **compare_weather**: Ask "compare weather between London and Tokyo"

### **Test Commands:**
- "hello" - Should work ONLY with your server
- "compare weather between Paris and New York" - Custom feature

## **Method 4: Server URL Verification**

### **Check Your MCP UI Configuration:**
Make sure you're using the correct URL:
- **Debug Server**: `http://127.0.0.1:8001/sse`
- **Main Server**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse`

### **Wrong URLs that won't work:**
- ❌ `http://127.0.0.1:8001` (missing /sse)
- ❌ `http://localhost:8001/sse` (use 127.0.0.1)
- ❌ `https://127.0.0.1:8001/sse` (use http, not https)

## **Method 5: Disable Default Weather Tools**

If MCP UI has built-in weather tools:
1. Look for settings to disable default tools
2. Or remove other weather-related server configurations
3. Use ONLY your custom server

## **Method 6: Use Unique City Names**

Test with cities that might not be in default weather databases:
- "weather in Timbuktu"
- "weather in Bhutan"
- "weather in Faroe Islands"

Your server uses OpenWeatherMap which has extensive city coverage.

## **Method 7: Check Response Format**

### **Your Server Response Format:**
```
🌤️ [YOUR CUSTOM MCP SERVER] Weather in Paris: 24.1°C, Clouds, 65% humidity
```

### **Typical Default Tool Format:**
```
The weather in Paris is 24°C with cloudy conditions.
```

## **🚨 Clear Signs You're Using YOUR Server:**

✅ **Response contains**: `🌤️ [YOUR CUSTOM MCP SERVER]`
✅ **Terminal shows**: Debug logs when you ask questions
✅ **Hello command works**: Returns the custom hello message
✅ **Compare weather works**: Custom comparison feature

## **🚨 Signs You're Using a Default Tool:**

❌ **No custom prefix** in responses
❌ **No terminal logs** when asking questions  
❌ **Hello command fails** or returns generic response
❌ **Different response format** than your server

## **Quick Verification Steps:**

1. **Test the Hello Command:**
   - Ask: "hello"
   - Expected: "🌤️ [YOUR CUSTOM MCP SERVER] Hello! This response proves..."

2. **Watch the Terminal:**
   - Ask: "weather in London"
   - Expected: Debug logs appear in terminal

3. **Check Response Format:**
   - Look for: `🌤️ [YOUR CUSTOM MCP SERVER]` prefix
   - Expected: All weather responses have this prefix

## **Current Server Status:**

- **Debug Server**: Running on port 8001 with unique signatures
- **Main Server**: Running on port 8000 (may still be active)
- **API Key**: Configured (real weather data)
- **CORS**: Enabled for web clients

**Use this URL in MCP UI**: `http://127.0.0.1:8001/sse`

Now when you ask for weather, you'll KNOW it's coming from your custom server! 🎯
